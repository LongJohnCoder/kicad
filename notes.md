compile from source:

gotchas:

* copy block choose 'save block'
* paste no shortcut, is a button on the toolbar
* F to move components between layers
* set origin grid, have to press space while clicking
* footprint editor libraries can't be relative paths
* search paths don't work in library editor; choose the exact file instead

# aim

try to get dimensions right and reduce pitting

# svg -> print

scale 100.4 % to get dimensions right

# test pattern

etchtest.pro made with 5 sets of the same patterns

3 staggered lines at 0.2, 0.25, 0.3 and 0.35 mm trace/spacing

# exposure test Tue Oct 31 19:36:39 CET 2017

used the test pattern  with 5 different timings
on 170gsm tracing paper
covering was done with a strip of aluminium sticky tape and moved every minute.

4, 5, 6, 7, 10 minutes

on the board these got assigned to:

8, 7, 6, 5, 4 (board wrong way round and forgot to move the covering first 2 minutes)

# etching

about 10 minutes with bubbling warm etchant.

# results

most reliable looking traces are:

* 6 minutes UV
* 12 minutes etch
* 0.3mm track and space

0.25mm track and space possible but looks more likely to have problems.
